# Exploring BlockChain For the First Time

> <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Blockchain lets you implement a business process when you need to trust data and participants without using a central database.</p>

<code>
Suppose you are a solutions architect at a dairy processing company that produces ice cream. You use a supply chain to receive raw dairy goods from multiple dairies. Your company ships packaged ice cream to various retailers. There has been food quality and safety issues caused by improper temperature storage during shipment. Because multiple companies are responsible to ship and store the product, it has been difficult to identify the supply chain party at fault. You want to create a system that identifies issues in the supply chain quickly. Each supply chain company wants to integrate their existing systems with the solution and independently audit shipments if there is a food safety recall.

## What is blockchain

<p>Blockchain is a record-keeping and contract-enforcement technology that uses cryptography to make it extremely difficult to change previous history.<br> It allows participants to share workstreams by tracking changes on a shared ledger.</p>

<hr>

## Distributed ledger
<p> 
Blockchain technology is referred to as a distributed ledger. Just like an accounting ledger, the distributed ledger is a history of transactions. Each transaction in the ledger affects the final state.
<br>
Blockchain networks that are distributed among participants are called a consortium network. The consortium network gives each partner visibility into every transaction that occurs on the network.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Blockchain uses consensus rules to ensure data is consistent across nodes. It also uses cryptography to enable participants to trust the data. Specifically, it prevents any individual participant or minority of participants from modifying history. Since blockchain is decentralized, solutions that can use a decentralized database work best. For example, you have a requirement to support multiple companies with no central authority due to cost, control, or being a single point of failure.
